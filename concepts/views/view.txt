====== View ======

A Sproutcore view is an object containing the logic of a view. This means it contains properties to which a value can be bound, observers that deal with data extraction from the data bound to the view, but it doesn't contain the code for actually creating and updating the HTML elements displaying the data.

In order to display the view, a view has a createRenderer and an updateRenderer function. 

The createRenderer function sets up the link from the view to the renderer object and adds the renderer object to the update cycle.

The updateRenderer function is called indirectly by the .set() function or binding update and needs to call the renderer  to pass it the correct values. It calls the renderers .attr() function with an object containing the properties and values the renderer should use to update the view.
