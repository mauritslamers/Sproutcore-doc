====== The Sproutcore View system ======

The concept behind the Sproutcore view system is that a view has to be bound to controllers and therefore views should update automatically when the content of the controller or the bound properties change. This allows a developer to concentrate on the program logic and let the view system follow what happens in the controller data.

In order to make the wrapped DOM elements to be redrawn or updated on changes only when the data they show changes, the view system splits up a view in two different parts: the view itself and the renderer.
This also allows for different theme renderers for the same view. 

===== The view =====

The view itself contains the logic of the view itself. A view sometimes needs to calculate additional values. The code that performs this logic also sets the values that need to be displayed. [[concepts:views:view | More...]]

===== Renderer system =====

The renderer system contains the code for rendering or updating the HTML that should actually be displayed. [[concepts:views:renderers | More...]]
