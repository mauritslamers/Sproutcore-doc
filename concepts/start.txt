====== Concepts used in Sproutcore =======

In an application development framework there are many concepts a developer has to understand to be able to make the application work as expected. This page tries to list all categories of concepts. 

===== Sproutcore (RunTime + Foundation) =====

While Sproutcore can be called an application development framework, it actually consists of a few different frameworks, which are all built upon some basic behaviour defined in the Runtime and Foundation frameworks. This section tells a lot about the concepts behind the entire framework, such as its implementation of the MVC paradigm, bindings and observers. If you are new to Sproutcore, reading this section is highly recommended! [[concepts:sproutcore:start | More...]]

===== The Data store framework ======

The Data store framework allows you to hook up your Sproutcore application to a server back end and to use the data from that server back end in a way consistent with the MVC paradigm. [[concepts:datastore:start | More...]]
