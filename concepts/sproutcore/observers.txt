====== Observers ======

Observers are functions that are used for monitoring property changes inside objects. These functions are fired when  the observed property or properties changes value. 
Observers are mostly useful for side-effects of these changes, such as some kind of data transformation.
Observers are not the same as [[computedproperty| computed properties ]].
As a best practice, observers should be used only for property observing inside the object the observer is in.

It is important to use observers properly and conciously. If an observer changes a value that indirectly also changes the value it is observing, this will most certainly result in an endless loop.
