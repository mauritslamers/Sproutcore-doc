====== Getters and Setters ======

Using bindings and observers in a language which doesn't support these actions by default requires a small price to pay. In order to have them work, the use of getter and setter functions is essential. The observing system has to be notified in a way that a value of a property is about to change or has changed and the .get() and .set() functions make this happen. 

If you want to update a property and want to have the observers watching that property to fire, you need to use the .set() function to set the value. The firing of the observers caused by this set function takes place as part of the [[runloop| RunLoop]].

There is another advantage with Getters and Setters in the sense that they also work for properties that do not exist (yet).
