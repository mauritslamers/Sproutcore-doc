====== sc_super() ======

In contrast with almost everything else, sc_super is not a JavaScript function, but is replaced by the build tools with the following:

<code javascript>
arguments.callee.base.apply(this, arguments);
</code>

This function call is a way to be able to get to the function of the original class you are either extending or creating. So, if you are extending a class and you want to initialise a specific variable you created without the risk of it becoming a class property, and you also want that behaviour from the parent class, you must use sc_super().
You can also use the direct code itself if you want, but sc_super(); is just a convenient way to do this.
