====== SproutCores Object Oriented system ======

JavaScript is an object oriented language. In contrast to many other object oriented languages, it doesn't have a class and instance system but has a prototypal inheritance system instead.

SproutCore implements a Cocoa like framework in JavaScript, so it needs to have a class and instance system. SproutCore therefore wraps the object and prototype system in such a way that they can be used as a class and instance system. Of course, the result is still Javascript, which means it is still possible to use it very flexibly.

The flexibility and functional nature of this system becomes apparent as the method to create both classes and instances are function calls. These function calls are often given a parameter in the form of an object literal: an object with properties and methods defined on the spot.
