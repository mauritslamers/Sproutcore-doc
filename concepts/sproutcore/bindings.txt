====== Bindings ======

Bindings are a kind of symbolic links. When a value changes on one side of the binding, it will normally cause the value on the other side of the binding to update.
Bindings are more flexible than symbolic links as they allow you to define what direction that value propagation should take place.

Bindings are ideal for propagating value changes between objects. The main use of bindings within a SproutCore application is binding views to controllers. Setting a value to a controller will cause the bound view to automatically update itself.
