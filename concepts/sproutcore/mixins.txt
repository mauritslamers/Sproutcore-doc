====== Mixins ======

This way of dealing with multiple inheritance in an Object Oriented environment originates in Ruby.
A mixin is an object which isn't used as itself or as a class, but rather used as a source to copy functionality from. This means that no connection exists from the object the functionality is copied onto and the mixin object. 
This manner of inheritance makes it easier to do multiple inheritance because changes to the mixin while the application is running doesn't have any consequences for the objects inheriting the mixins functionality.
