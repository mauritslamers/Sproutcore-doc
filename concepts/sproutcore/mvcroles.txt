====== Roles of Models, Views and Controllers ======

The roles of models, views and controllers are quite strict, in the sense that they don't do inter-object communication themselves:

  * Model: A model just describes the layout of data and shouldn't contain functionality that doesn't deal directly with the model itself
  * View: A view is an object describing how a particular view should look like, and contains functionality to deal with displaying data.
  * Controller: A controller is an object describing what actions should be taken and contain the main functionality of the application.

These objects communicate mainly through bindings, which explains why they normally only have to deal with internal matters.
