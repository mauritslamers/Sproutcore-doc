====== Queries ======

Queries form a special way of finding data in your store as they allow a SQL like approach to searching.
A query will always return a RecordArray.

===== Local queries =====

Local queries are queries done on data that resides in the store. If necessary, the Store will automatically retrieve extra data.

Every query will cause the data sources fetch function to be called.


===== Remote queries =====

first loadQueryResults() then dataSourceDidFetchQuery() )...
