alexiskander: .design is a special form of .extend
[19:51] mauritslamers: ah ok 
[19:51] alexiskander: when a view is instantiated, createChildViews is called
[19:52] hvgotcodes: alexiskander: right
[19:52] alexiskander: this loops over the child views, and if any are classes, it calls .create()
[19:52] hvgotcodes: the childViews array, right?
[19:52] alexiskander: and sets this[theKeyListedInChildViews] = theCreatedView;
[19:52] alexiskander: right
[19:52] hvgotcodes: right so if you have childViews: 'input1 input1'.w()
[19:53] hvgotcodes: and then input1 and input2 defined as props on the view
[19:53] hvgotcodes: input1 and input2 are design
[19:53] alexiskander: right
[19:53] alexiskander: you can also use .extend
[19:53] hvgotcodes: when CCV runs, does it replace the design with the actual instance?
[19:53] alexiskander: yes
[19:53] hvgotcodes: right
[19:54] alexiskander: in effect, it does:
[19:54] hvgotcodes: thats what i am seeing
[19:54] alexiskander: this[theKeyInChildViews] = this[theKeyInChildViews].create()
[19:54] alexiskander: though there is a bit more involved
[19:54] hvgotcodes: aaah
[19:54] hvgotcodes: right
[19:54] hvgotcodes: cool
