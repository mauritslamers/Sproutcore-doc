====== Project Folder ======

The first thing we will need to do is creating our project folder. In your home folder we assume you have  a folder called Development. We will start with creating our project folder inside this folder by giving the following commands at the terminal prompt.

<code>
cd Development
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
</code>

We now created and entered our project folder. One of the first things to do next is creating a file called ''Buildfile''. This file will be used by the SproutCore development environment to pull in all the necessary bits our application will need. The contents of this file for our new project is shown below.

<code ruby Buildfile>
# myProject Buildfile

# initial buildfile information 
config :all, :required => :sproutcore
</code>

This bit of information will tell the development environment we will need the SproutCore framework loaded before our own application is loaded.
