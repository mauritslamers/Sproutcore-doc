Next we need to create a folder called 'apps'. 

<code>
mkdir apps
cd apps
</code>

We now created and entered the apps folder. In this folder we will put all applications the current project will contain. As we only want to build a single application, we will only have one folder inside this apps folder, called myproject.

<code>
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
</code>

This application folder will contain all files needed for our application. 
Inside this folder we will create two files forming the basis for our application: ''core.js'' and ''main.js''.

<code javascript core.js>
MyProject = SC.Application.create({

  NAMESPACE: 'MyProject',
  VERSION: '0.1.0',

  store: SC.Store.create().from(SC.Record.FIXTURES)

}) ;
</code>

The ''core.js'' file defines your application and offers you a place to define certain basic parts of your application, like global variables or singleton objects. We put in a store here, which we will need later to be able to handle data inside the application.

<code javascript main.js>
MyProject.main = function main() {

  MyProject.getPath('mainPage.mainPane').append() ;

} ;

function main() { Meetme.main(); }
</code>

The ''main.js'' file defines the main function of your application. This function is called to start your application.

These two files are still not enough to get something you can look at. They are essential though for every application.
Let's continue building our application by creating a resources folder in the next part of our tutorial.
