====== Javascript ======

Javascript is a peculiar but remarkable programming language, both in history as in workings. Moreover, its name is a complete mismatch: it has very little inheritance from Java and it is nothing like a script language.

Javascript is a Object Oriented functional language. While its syntax is derived from C and Java, the nature of the language much more resembles the classical functional languages as Lisp and Scheme.
