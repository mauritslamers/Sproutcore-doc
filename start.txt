**Sproutcore** is a framework for producing fast, reliable and maintainable web applications with demanding interactivity and state-management requirements. It's designed for developers who don't want their framework to give up before they're finished. It is a framework designed to create applications that resemble desktop applications, but run inside a browser.

This is accomplished using a number of technologies:
  * Model-View-Controller architecture and Key-Value Observing
  * Client-side HTML generation, completely server-agnostic
  * Integrated build tools to package files for minimal download time and client-side caching
  * Starting code generated from templates to provide code structure
  * OS-agnostic development environment for rapid coding/testing cycles
  * A language and framework for unit-testing

Sproutcore is very suitable for web applications requiring dynamical interfaces, such as:
  * multi-user administrative applications
  * web applications requiring much interaction
  * dynamic data driven representation applications

Sproutcore can of course be used to develop applications that don't need dynamic interfaces such as blog applications or animated elements on a web page. Using the framework for this kind of application will be a suboptimal experience however, and a different approach could well be more suitable.

In writing this documentation we assume that the reader will be a developer. The developer does not need to know much about Javascript, but is strongly advised to read into the language and watch the videos.
